## DigitalCrafts Project Requirements

#### Project Kickoff

Front End Project start: **Monday, July 24th**

Front End Project presentation: **Friday, August 4th**

#### Description

- Your task is to form teams and build something awesome!
- You'll be using the front-end skills you've developed over the last several weeks.
- Each team must present their project in the afternoon of Friday, August 4th.

#### Acceptance Criteria

- Implement a Responsive Design that works in the Chrome browser on desktops, iOS devices, and Android devices.
- Access at least 2 remote APIs (data mashup!)
- Use fewer than 3 global variables (numerous constants are fine, but should be limited to primitive values like numbers and strings)

#### Workflow Requirements

- You'll be working in assigned groups. (link up with group member assignments)
- Create a GitHub repo (add all group members as collaborators)
- Collaborate using PRs (Pull Requests), making sure to tag a reviewer for approval
- A reviewer must code review through Github and approve before the PR can be merged. If there are no comments, the code has spaghetti, or has difficult-to-read spots, code review didn't happen.
- Use a feature tracking system, such as:
  - GitHub project (kanban board)
  - Trello

##### Suggested PR rejection criteria

- Does not fulfill the feature
- Breaks other feature
- Does not follow the team's coding style/standards
- Too many commits in a single PR (meaning too much to review)
- Code in a commit does not match the commit message
- The commit message is vague

#### Recommendations

##### DO

- Choose a problem to solve.
- Build the app around solving that problem.
- Choose APIs whose data directly address the problem.
- COMMUNICATE early, and often!
- Keep it SIMPLE! (No swords where butter knives will do!)

##### DO NOT

- Fall in love with your code (because it's gonna change!).
- Work in a silo and forget to talk to your team.

#### How to submit

- Navigate to [DigitalCrafts Project Page](https://digitalcrafts.instructure.com/courses/286/assignments/14044?module_item_id=71529) to submit project!
